## **DOM and DOM Manipulation**

**DOM (Document-Object Model)**
- It is structured representation of an HTML Document.
- It is used to connect webpages to scripts like - JavaScript.
- Each tag formulates a box. So, we boxes inside of a main box. For each HTML box, there is an 
object in the DOM that we can access and interact with.

JavaScript and DOM are two different things. Though we implement DOM with the help of JavaScript.
Now, we are gonna use JavaScript to interact with the webpage. For that we are going to use some
special methods. 

These methods are the functions attached to the `document` object. So, this is the
object which gives us acces and let us manipulate the DOM.
